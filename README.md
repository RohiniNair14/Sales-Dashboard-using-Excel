# Sales-Dashboard-using-Excel

This project involves the creation of a comprehensive sales dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The objective of the project is to analyze sales data from 2014 to 2017, identify key trends, and derive actionable insights regarding product categories, sub-categories, and customer contributions to overall sales. The dashboard provides an interactive platform for users to explore sales data, allowing them to filter by year and delve into various aspects of the sales performance.

## Business Problem
The main business problem addressed by this project is to understand which product categories are driving the highest sales and identify the top customers contributing to these sales. The company sells products under three main categories: Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology. The goal is to provide insights that can inform business strategies and decision-making processes.

## Data Collection
The data used for this project was collected for the years 2014 to 2017. The dataset includes information about order dates, product categories, sub-categories, customer details, and sales figures.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
### 1. Data Transformation:
The raw data was converted into an appropriate format for analysis.
New columns were added to extract the year and month from the order date to facilitate time-based analysis.
### 2. Handling Missing Values and Duplicates:
All missing values were identified and appropriately handled.
Duplicate records were removed to ensure data integrity.

## Analysis

### 1. Pivot Tables and Charts:

Separate sheets were created to develop pivot tables and charts, providing a structured approach to data analysis.
These pivot tables and charts were used to summarize sales data by year, month, category, sub-category, and customer.

### 2. Sales Trends and Insights:

The analysis focused on identifying sales trends over the years and within each month.
Interactive slicers were added to the dashboard, allowing users to filter data by year and explore sales performance dynamically.

## Key Findings
### 1. Category Performance:

Technology: Products in the technology category consistently had the highest sales across all four years.
Furniture: Products in the furniture category had the lowest sales overall, although there were fluctuations, with significant sales peaks in December 2014.
### 2. Top Customers:

The top 5 customers for each year were identified, highlighting the key contributors to the company's sales.
### 3. Yearly and Monthly Trends:

Detailed analysis of sales trends for each category revealed seasonal patterns and helped pinpoint the best and worst performing months.
